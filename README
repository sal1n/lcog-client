Being set on the idea
Of getting to Atlantis,
You have discovered of course
Only the Ship of Fools is
Making the voyage this year..

Lost Colonies Of Guernsey [lcog] is a Play By EMail [pbem] similar to VGA 
Planets game written in Ruby by James Rowe.  

This is a client for the game written in C# using WinForms for the .NET 3.5+ 
framework and the Mono 2.0+ framework.

Implements entire 2.0 ruleset (game host as at April 2010).

@todo
1.  Re-implement zoom function on star map.
2.  Drawing lines that span both axis currently only works for 2 out of 4 states.
3.  Persist historic information.
4.  Group and order ships as fleets.
5.  Maintain state, so orders lost when client closed.  Need to reload the order xml file.
