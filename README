Lost Colonies Of Guernsey [lcog] is a Play By EMail [pbem] similar to VGA Planets game written in Ruby by James Rowe.  

This is a client for the game written in C# using WinForms for the .NET 2.0+ framework and the Mono 2.0+ framework.

Known Issues / todo
------------
1.  Map zoom function currently disabled.
2.  Drawing lines that span both axis currently only works for 2 out of 4 states.
3.  Requires files in same directory as the executable.
4.  Historic information not persisted.
5.  Group and order ships as fleets.
6.  Maintain state, so orders lost when client closed.  Need to reload the order xml file.
